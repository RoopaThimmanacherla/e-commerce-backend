# Description
* This application was created as part of a UT Full Stack Coding Bootcamp challenge. Given the starter code of a working Express.js API, code was configured to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

Code syncs Sequelize models to a MySQL database on the server start, includes column definitions for all four models and model associations, and provides the following GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes:

# Category
* GET all categories, GET a single category by ID, POST(create) a new category, PUT(update) and existing category by ID, and DELETE an existing category by ID.

# Tag

* GET all tags, GET a single tag by ID, POST(create) a new tag, PUT(update) an existing tag by ID, and DELETE an existing tag by ID.

# Product (including ProductTag)
* GET all products, GET products by ID, and DELETE products by ID. POST(create) and PUT(update) product routes were provided in starter code.
